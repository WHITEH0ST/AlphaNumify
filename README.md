# AlphaNumify
A simple generator for business marketing. [USA ONLY]



# Usage


The default method for generating leads, is:

py gen.py -c NUMBER_OF_LEADS -a AREA_CODES i.e.
py gen.py -c 10000 -a 418,912,480


But if you do not want carrier sort and some minor validation, As it doesnt support all area codes just yet
You can simply pass a no syntax with count and area codes.
e.g.
py gen.py -c 10000 -a 418,912,480 --no-syntax

The above command will generate numbers randomly with your area codes and ignore everything else.


For other use cases, Please run the command below for help.
COMMAND:

py gen.py -h
